This is a program that will help you keep a Hi-Lo count (not advertising but watch the movie '21' for more info or just google Hi-Lo BlackJack) so you could have more chances of winning at online blackjack tables.
 Please note the number of decks you are playing and change the variable deckNum to that number, eg. I was playing with 6 deck of cards so for me it was [deckNum = 6]
 at MyVars block of code (look below). To run the program simply open a terminal cd into the folder that you have the file and give 
[python blackJackHL.py],
 also while playing and counting the cards note the terminal, it will give you info about how many decks are left in the "dealer's shoe".
 If you have any questions feel free to contact me,

 In the end, always keep in mind that online blackjack gambling companies, don't want you to win so if they want you to loose you WILL LOOSE,
 so play for fun and use your mind don't gamble...!
